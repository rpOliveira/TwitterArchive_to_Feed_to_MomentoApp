#Old Tweets -> Momento App

1) Download your twitter archive. The files you will need are in tweets/data/js/tweets

2) Choose which files you want to import (you'll probably just want to import the old tweets that are not in the Momento's database).

3) Run the *tunearchive.sh* script in the same folder (it will change the original files).

4) Copy the resulting *old_tweets.js* to your server and the *twitter_archive_feed.php* file. 

5) The feed url will be  yourserverurlpath/twitter_archive_feed.php

6) Add the web feed in the Momento app. It may take a while.
